**Build python environment container image with necessary dependencies and packages using docker**

Put your venv files in the following directory ./myproject

Docker build .

Or

Docker build â€“t shahzirin/python:latest . -> You can tag the images build so you can reference easier rather then using the id. Shahzirin is the docker id, redis is the repo/project name and the last point Is the version
